A Caesar cipher is a approach to encoding messages by shifting each letter in a message along the alphabet by a constant amount k. 
This project is a program that asks user to input some random constant as well as a string to be encoded. 
Then it returns the encoded message according to the constant user gives and decode that encoded message. 
At the end of the program, user can enter 'y' to play again, otherwise, 'n' to quit.
