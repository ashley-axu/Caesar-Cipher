# Caesar Cipher
- Caesar Cipher is a approach to encoding messages by shifting each letter in a message along the alphabet by a constant amount k. 

- This project is a program that asks user to input some random constant as well as a string to be encoded. 

- Then it returns the encoded message according to the constant user gives and decode that encoded message.
